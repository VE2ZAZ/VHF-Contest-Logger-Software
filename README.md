This amateur radio software provides the ability to log and display the QSOs (radio contacts) made during one of the ARRL VHF, NA VHF Sprints or various NA Microwave contests. It offers a simple and efficient interface customized for these contests. The interface is distributed over several independent windows, which allows the user to better organize the desktop. The software performs continuous "dupe checks" and score calculation. It also displays the worked grid squares using color boxes on a zoom-able Maidenhead grid world map. Both 4-character and 6-character grid square logging is supported. Digital QSOs made on the WSJT-X software can be automatically logged. To save the contest information, the script uses a simple CSV (comma-separated text) file; no complex database is used. Since this software is a python script, it can be run on Linux, Windows and Mac, once the python-3 interpreter is installed. Another benefit of being a Python script is that it uses a simple text file as source code. It can thus be easily improved and customized by the user. Though it is customized for VHF and Microwave contesting, this software can also be used for general logging of VHF/UHF contacts.
